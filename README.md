# NEAT-Flappy-Bird
Build with pygame and NEAT-Python library
## First AI project 
My first small project with neural networks. A bit messy but it works!
There is a few files:
    \ngame.py - Pure self-created Flappy Bird
    \ngame_NEAT.py - Game with NEAT implemented 
    \nneat-config.txt - File with configuration for NEAT (it's very basic)
