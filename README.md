# NEAT-Flappy-Bird
Build with pygame and NEAT-Python library
## First AI project 
My first small project with neural networks. A bit messy but it works!\
There are a few files:\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;game.py - Pure self-created Flappy Bird\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;game_NEAT.py - Game with NEAT implemented\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neat-config.txt - File with configuration for NEAT (it's very basic)\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Game Objects,Sound Efects,UI - Flappy Bird ASSETS by kosresetr55\
